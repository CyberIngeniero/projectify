Templates Projectify! supports the use of YAML templates to customize the setup of your Python projects. This allows you to define reusable configurations that can be quickly applied when starting a new project. What are Templates? Templates in Projectify! are predefined configurations that specify the structure, dependencies, and settings for a new project. By using templates, you can ensure consistency across your projects and save time on repetitive setup tasks. Creating a Template Templates are written in YAML format and stored in the templates directory within your project or in a central repository for reuse across multiple projects. Example Template Here\u2019s an example of a simple YAML template: # Template Name: basic-python-project # Project structure structure: - src/ - src/__init__.py - tests/ - tests/__init__.py - README.md - setup.py # Dependencies dependencies: - colorama - pytest - ruff # Optional: Define a Python version python_version: \"3.9\" # Optional: Initialize Git repository git_init: true # Optional: Add pre-commit hooks pre_commit_hooks: - id: ruff name: Ruff Linter entry: ruff language: python files: \\.py$ - id: black name: Black Formatter entry: black language: python files: \\.py$ # Dockerfile setup dockerfile: from: python:3.9-slim workdir: /app copy: - requirements.txt . run: pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt cmd: python main.py # Makefile setup makefile: install: - pip install -r requirements.txt test: - pytest lint: - ruff . Template Breakdown structure : Specifies the directories and files to create in the new project. dependencies : Lists the Python packages to install in the virtual environment. python_version : Optionally sets the Python version for the virtual environment. git_init : If set to true , initializes a Git repository in the new project. pre_commit_hooks : Defines pre-commit hooks to automate code quality checks. dockerfile : Provides instructions for generating a Dockerfile in the project. makefile : Defines common Makefile commands for easy project management. Using a Template To use a template with Projectify!, specify the template name during the project initialization: projectify init --template basic-python-project This command will create a new project using the basic-python template, generating the structure, installing dependencies, and setting up any other configurations defined in the template. Best Practices Reuse Templates : Store templates in a central repository or share them across teams to promote consistency. Customize as Needed : Modify templates to suit the specific needs of different projects or teams. Document Templates : Provide clear documentation for each template, so others can easily understand and use them. Sharing Templates You can share your templates with others by publishing them in a central repository or including them in your project's repository. This allows you to collaborate with others and reuse configurations across different projects. Final Thoughts Templates in Projectify! provide a powerful way to standardize and streamline the setup of Python projects.
